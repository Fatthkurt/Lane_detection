This repository contains my solution for the Bosch Mobility Challenge, focusing on lane detection using OpenCV. 
The project aims to enhance the perception of autonomous vehicles by accurately detecting and tracking lanes on the road. 
The implemented algorithm leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning models to achieve robust lane detection in various driving conditions.

This project was developed with OpenCV as our first test for the Bosch Mobility Challenge. 
Further development and contributions are ongoing.
